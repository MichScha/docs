### Which ESP microcontrollers are supported?
  
  The code and circuit have been tested with a few ESP8266 development boards such as the Wemos D1 Mini, Wemos D1 Mini Pro, Nodemcu0.9 and Nodemcu2 dev boards. It will also work on bare ESP8266 chips such as the ESP-12E but do make sure you disabled the LED support and wire the UART correctly as the code doesn't use the normal Rx and Tx pins.
