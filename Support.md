If you are looking for support, have a question or suggestion here are some suggested methods:

1. If the request is **hardware** related go to [BBQKees' EMS Gateway Documentation](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/).
2. Contact the **Support Community** using [Discord](https://discord.gg/3J3GgnzpyT) for asking general questions and chatting with other users. You have better chances to getting fast responses here.
3. **Search** in existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues) as you might find an answer to your question in current or closed issues.
4. **Create a new issue** in GitHub, either a [Bug Report](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) for reporting possible defects, a [Feature Request](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) for a new idea or a [Question](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=questions---troubleshooting.md) for general support. When creating the issue make sure you attach the EMS-ESP support information either using http://ems-esp.local/api/system/info or by clicking on `Support Info` button from the Help page in the Web UI.
