### Support Community

- [Search in GitHub Issues](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues): You might find an answer to your question by searching current or closed issues

### Creating an new request

- [Bug Report](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=bug_report.md): For reporting possible defects
- [Feature Request](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=feature_request.md): For requesting features/functions
- [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=questions---troubleshooting.md): As a last resort, you can open new _Troubleshooting & Question_ issue on GitHub if the solution could not be found using the other channels. Just remember: the more info you provide the more chances you'll have to get an accurate answer

When submitting issues it's helpful to provide details of your system setup and status. This can be done by generating a report either directly from the WebUI (underhelp) or using http://ems-esp.local/api/system/info and http://ems-esp.local/api/system/settings. Attaching these to the GitHub issue will help tremendously.
