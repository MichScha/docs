If you plan to make changes to the web (css/html/js) you can simulate the front-end by installing the npm modules in the `wsemulator` folder:
```sh
cd tools\wsemulator
npm ci
```
for the first time and then using the `run` script to start it. e.g. `./run` or `./run.sh` just `run` depending on the OS.
The password for the web admin user is **neo**.
