If you are looking for support, have a question or suggestion there are options:

- If the request is **hardware** related go to [BBQKees' EMS Gateway Documentation](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/).
- Reaching out to the **Support Community** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3J3GgnzpyT) is a good place for asking general questions and chatting with other users. You have better chances to getting fast responses here.
- **Search** in existing open and closed [GitHub issues](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues) as you might find an answer to your question.
- As a last resort **create a new GitHub issue**, either
  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    - a [Bug Report](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) for reporting possible defects,
    - a [Feature Request](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) for a new idea or
    - a [Question](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=questions---troubleshooting.md) for general support.

!!! tip "important!"

    When creating a new GitHub issue make sure you attach the EMS-ESP support information. You can fetch this from the URL [http://<hostname\>/api/system/info](http://ems-esp.local/api/system/info) or by clicking on the `Support Info` button from the Help page in the WebUI.
