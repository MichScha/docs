The various types from newer EMS+ controllers like the MC110 found in GB122/125's.

In the schema below the first number represent the byte position, so 1 being the first byte of the message block (which is the 5th byte of an EMS 1.0 telegram). 

This information was compiled with most if it coming from https://github.com/Th3M3/buderus_ems-wiki.
Some positions has changed due to user feedback. Positions as offset, counting from 0.  

## Type 0xD1: UBAOutdoorTemp

11 = bit 0 = flame yes/no, bit 1 = pump active yes/no, bit 2 = heating active yes/no
13 - 14 temperature value, unknown
17 - 18 return temperature
19 - 20 = flame current * 10 in uA
21 = system pressure * 10 in bar
24 - 25 = same as bytes 7-8
```

## Type 0xE5: UBAMonitorSlow

Sent every 60 seconds

2 =
 bit 0 = fuel valve 1 open
 bit 1 = fuel valve 2 open
 bit 2 = blower on
 bit 3 = ignition on
 bit 4 = oil preheater on
 bit 5 = boiler circuit pump on
 bit 6 = 3-way valve on WW
 bit 7 = circulating pump on
6 -7 = exhaust temperature
10 - 12 = total burner starts
13 - 15 = burner operating hours
16 - 18 = burner level 2 operating hours
19 - 21 = Burner operating hours due to heating demand (excluding DHW preparation)
22 - 24 = Burner starting by heat demand (excluding WW-preparation)
25 = Heating circuit pump modulation %
```

## Type 0xE6: UBA Paramter 

```
0 = heating activated
1 = heating temperature
4 = burner max power
5 = burner min power
8 = boiler hysteresis off
9 = boiler hysteresis on
10 = burner min cycle time
```

## Type 0xE9: DHW status
  
Sent every 10 seconds

```
0 = DHW setpoint (with setpoint = "off": 0x0A = 10 Â° C)
1 - 2 = hot water actual value * 10
3 - 4 = hot water 2 actual value * 10
9 = setpoint thermal disinfection
10 = setpoint daily heating temperature
12 = 
 bit 0 : DHW preparation activated by automatic program
 bit 2 : DHW preparation activated by one-time charge
 bit 3 : DHW preparation activated by thermal disinfection
 bit 4 : DHW preparation active (always 1 if bit 0, 2 or 3 also 1)
13 =
 bit 0 : Circulation day mode (or by single charge / th. disinfection activated)
